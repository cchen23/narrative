Sarah, happy, Yes, "Oh hi there", she, "You may write me down in history with your bitter, twisted lies, you may trod me in the very dirt but still, like dust, I will rise."
Julian, happy, Yes, "It has been too long", he, "I wandered lonely as a cloud that floats on high over vales and hills, when all at once I saw a crowd, A host, of golden daffodils."
